# IOT Ambient Weather Station

An IOT weather weather station that reacts to for basic weather events and prompts with a color.

## Summary

I built an internet connected weather station that reacts to San Francisco weather events published by Weather Underground via IFTTT. The station is currently set up to display 4 types of events that are important to me: Rain, Cloudy, Hot and Perfect. The purpose of the device is to decrease reliance on smart phones and utilize passive indication of how the weather is without stepping outside. Each event is mapped to a specific color, RAIN = CYAN, CLOUDY = INDIGO, HOT = REDORANGE, PERFECT = DEEPPINK. The colors prompt me to pick the appropriate clothing before leaving from my house in the East Bay. This simple tool will make it easier by making sure I leave dressed appropriately.

## Component Parts

On the hardware side my project consists of: 
- Particle Photon (Wifi Microcontroller) to transmit data from the cloud and communicate with LED's (INPUT / OUTPUT)
- 24 NeoPixel Ring displays the information that is dependent on the situation (OUTPUT)
- Standard buttons x 2 are my ability to test and control the LED states (INPUT)

On the software side of things I am using
- Particle.Build (web not IDE) interface which communicates with the Photon and receives information from IFTTT (INPUT / OUTPUT)
- IFTTT.com (If this then that) platform. This allows data to be sent in real time. This is an attractive solution for tracjing variable weather conditions without having to install multiple libraries and sensors. (INPUT)

## Challenges

I had many. My main mistake was working with the IFTTT applets while at school. The network was not friendly since the level of security, and I lost a lot of hours because events would not publish.

I was working with bad of poorly calibrated weather sensors. I did not know how to trouble shoot and wasted a lot of time trying to get them to work.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Ordered parts and started woking on IFTTT (did not go well)
- Week 3: Tinkered with IFTTT, did not go well.
- Week 4: Switch my plan to using live sensors. This was not working out and I started to freak out.
- Week 5: Present, this was pretty bad too. I wasn't able to produce a working prototype.
- Week 6: Started to revive IFTTT using home network, it worked well!
